    "description": [
      "I’m Jack, a 20-year-old final-year Computer Science student at The University of Sheffield with a strong builder’s mindset and a drive to merge creativity with computation. My current dissertation focuses on 3D human motion generation from text prompts, where the goal is to improve the editability and usability of existing models by building on current research or developing new approaches. My work spans software engineering, AI research, and computer graphics, and I’m most engaged when designing systems that are both technically rigorous and visually expressive.",
      
      "I attended John F Kennedy School in Hemel Hempstead for secondary school and sixth form, achieving 10 GCSEs and A-levels including an A* in Maths, an A in Computer Science, a B in Further Maths, and a B in Physics. Since starting university, I have consistently performed strongly in both coursework and examinations and am currently on track to graduate with a first-class degree.",
      
      "My academic path has been deliberately broad. I have built and trained machine learning models, explored reinforcement learning and classical ML techniques, and designed and delivered full-stack web applications for real-world clients. Alongside this, I have worked closely with SELSA (Student Experience of Learning and Student Assessment), contributing to improvements in teaching quality across my department and gaining insight into feedback loops and the human side of engineering.",
      
      "Outside formal coursework, I regularly pursue technically demanding passion projects. I built a software rasterizer from scratch in Python, implementing a full 3D graphics pipeline including projection, rasterization, and z-buffering, which gave me a deeper understanding of how GPUs operate at a low level. I have also explored offline AI systems, experimenting with small language models and local inference runtimes that can run entirely on-device, with the long-term ambition of enabling private, local AI tools for individuals and businesses.",
      
      "I’m not only a developer but also an entrepreneur. I founded a small business creating websites for local companies, handling the full lifecycle from UI/UX design through deployment and maintenance. This experience strengthened my appreciation for shipping reliable, polished software and for communicating complex technical ideas clearly to non-technical stakeholders.",
      
      "Beyond technology, I actively seek challenge and exploration. I am a boulderer and judoka, and I recently spent a month hitchhiking across Europe — travelling from Croatia through France and Spain to Morocco — where I volunteered for a week in a small village near the Sahara Desert. These experiences have sharpened my ability to stay calm under pressure, adapt quickly to changing conditions, and connect with people from very different backgrounds.",
      
      "At my core, I enjoy solving hard problems and building things that matter. Whether I’m designing a neural architecture, debugging a rendering engine, or climbing a route that initially feels impossible, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and the satisfaction of turning ideas into reality.",
      
      "I am currently seeking opportunities in AI research, full-stack engineering, or technically demanding leadership roles.",
      
      "I am an active participant in SELSA (Sheffield Engineering Leadership and Service Award), regularly attending industry talks, workshops, and networking events to develop both my technical and leadership skills.",
      
      "I am also a member of my university’s hitchhiking society. I have hitchhiked from Sheffield to Porto, from Sheffield to Slovakia, and most recently from Croatia to Morocco. I documented this journey on Instagram at @5001km.sidequest.",
      
      "Outside of computing, I hold a Grade 8 guitar qualification and climb regularly with friends in the Peak District and London. English is my native language, and I have been studying Arabic for approximately a year and a half."
