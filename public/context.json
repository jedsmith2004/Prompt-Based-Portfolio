    "description": [
      "I'm Jack, a 20 year old final-year Computer Science student at The University of Sheffield with a builder’s mindset and a strong desire to merge creativity with computation. I haven't been assigned a dissertation yet but my top choice is 'Estimating Cognitive Load through non-verbal facial cues', my second choice is 'Building a small transformer model (like chatgpt) from scratch, using the university's resources'. My work spans software engineering, AI research, and computer graphics — I thrive when I'm architecting systems that are both technically rigorous and visually expressive.",
      
      "My academic journey has been deliberately broad. I've built and trained machine learning models, explored reinforcement learning and classical ML techniques, and designed and delivered full-stack web applications for real-world clients. I've also worked closely with SELSA (Student Experience of Learning and Student Assessment) to improve teaching quality across my department, giving me insight into user feedback loops and the human side of engineering.",
      
      "Outside of coursework, I've developed passion projects that push my understanding of technology. I built a software rasterizer from scratch in Python, implementing my own 3D pipeline with projection, rasterization, and z-buffering — a project that taught me how to think like a GPU. I’ve also explored offline AI, experimenting with small LLMs and neural inference runtimes that can run entirely on-device, with the long-term ambition of bringing private, local AI tools to individuals and businesses who need them most.",
      
      "I’m not just a developer, but an entrepreneur: I started a small business designing websites for local businesses, managing everything from UI/UX design to deployment, and building direct relationships with clients. These experiences gave me a real appreciation for shipping polished, reliable software and communicating technical ideas clearly to non-technical stakeholders.",
      
      "Beyond technology, I live for challenge and exploration. I'm a boulderer and judoka, and I recently spent a month hitchhiking across Europe — from Croatia, through France and Spain, all the way to Morocco — where I volunteered for a week in a small village near the Sahara Desert. These experiences sharpen my ability to stay calm under pressure, adapt quickly to changing circumstances, and connect with people from all walks of life.",
      
      "At my core, I love solving problems and building things that matter. Whether it’s designing a neural network architecture, debugging a rendering engine, or climbing a wall that looks impossible, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and the joy of making ideas real.",
      "Currently seeking opportunities in AI research, full-stack engineering, or technical leadership roles.",
      "I'm an active participant in SELSA (Sheffield Engineering Leadership and Service Award), where I attend talks from industry experts, join workshops to develop my technical and leadership skills, and take part in networking events to expand my professional circle.",
      "I'm also a member of my university's hitchhiking society. I've hitchhiked from Sheffield to Porto and Sheffield to Slovakia, and this summer, my friend and I journeyed from Croatia all the way to Morocco. I documented the adventure on Instagram at @5001km.sidequest—go check it out!",
      "Outside of tech, I have a Grade 8 guitar qualification and rock climb regularly with friends, both up in the Peak District and down in London. I know English as my native language and I've been studying Arabic for a year and a half."
